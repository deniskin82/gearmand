Hi!

You've most likely downloaded this package as a tar.gz distribution,
so you'll want to read Getting Started. If you are interested in
developing or submitting patches to the project, read the Contributing
and Coding Style sections.


Getting Started
---------------

You can grab a released version of Gearman from http://launchpad.net/gearmand/. If you want to work on the latest code, please read the file HACKING.

To build, you can follow the normal:

./configure
make
make install

You can also run 'make test' before installing to make sure everything
checks out ok. Once you have it installed, you can start the Gearman
job server with:

gearmand -v

This will start it while printing some verbose messages. To try
running a job through it, look in the examples/ directory of this
source and run:

./reverse_worker

Once that is running, you can run your first job with:

./reverse_client "Hello, Gearman!"

If all goes well, the reverse_worker application should have output:

Job=H:lap:1 Workload=Hello, Gearman! Result=!namraeG ,olleH

While the reverse_client returned:

Result=!namraeG ,olleH

If you want to start writing your own client and workers, be sure to
check out the developer API at:

http://gearman.info/libgearman.html

You can also find other useful resources related to the project at:

Enjoy!


Contributing
------------

If you are getting this code from https://launchpad.net/gearmand
then continue reading. Otherwise these directions are not for you
(well maybe...).

To obtain code from https://launchpad.net/gearmand you will need to
issue the following command:

bzr branch lp:gearmand

Once the tree is branched you will need to build the "configure"
script. You can do this by running the script:

./bootstrap.sh -a

It will set up all of the files you need to build the package. At
that point it is just the typical "./configure; make; make test;
make install"

For a tarball release do a "make dist" and for an RPM type "make rpm".

For patches please create a branch on launchpad and propose it to be
merged into the trunk. You can find out more information on how to
do this at the launchpad help site:

https://help.launchpad.net/


Thanks and keep hacking!

Cheers,
