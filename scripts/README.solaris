smf_install.sh is a script that will install gearman as a service monitored
by the Solaris SMF.

It will define a user and group named gearmand, and create authorization and
profile definitions so that you can grant users the rights to start / stop 
or change the service.

You need administrative rights to run the profile shell script.
